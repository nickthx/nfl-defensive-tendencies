# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-29)

**Core value:** A recruiter can clone the repo, run a single command, and within 2 minutes understand both the analytical insight and the engineering rigor behind it.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation & FTN Pivot Calibration

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Foundation & FTN Pivot Calibration)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Context gathered — ready for `/gsd-plan-phase 1`
Last activity: 2026-04-29 — Phase 1 CONTEXT.md written (anchor selection rule, 4 pre-registered situations, repo name locked)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1 = pivot calibration, not blank-slate audit (researchers have already confirmed the FTN public schema; Phase 1 measures NaN rates and locks 3–4 anchor dimensions)
- Public repo name decided at end of Phase 1 (likely `nfl-defensive-tendencies`); working folder stays `nfl-coverage-tendencies` for git history continuity
- Coarse phase granularity adopted: 4 phases (synthesizer's 6-phase prior consolidated; rationale in ROADMAP.md Overview)
- `competitive_plays` SQL view is a Phase 2 SCHEMA deliverable (single source of truth for play-type and win-probability filtering across all analytical queries)
- Predictability score normalization (`H/log(k)` over fixed support OR KL-from-baseline) MUST be the FIRST cell of `02_predictability_modeling.ipynb` (Phase 3)
- Ship via GitHub MCP (Phase 4): repo creation, topic config, social preview, pinning all use GitHub MCP tools — not manual `git push`
